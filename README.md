## Product Overview

In an era of information overload, critical signals are often buried beneath noise. NewsFlash addresses this challenge by providing a structured, curated stream of news and market intelligence relevant to an organization’s strategic and operational context.

Rather than acting as a generic news feed, NewsFlash functions as an **organizational awareness layer**, enabling shared understanding, faster responses, and better-informed decisions across departments.
